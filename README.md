# Abstract

The objective of this vignette is to use a multitude of variables to predict binary win/loss outcomes of a game.

To determine which variables have strong correlations with game win, and thereby likely will serve as strong predictors, we will be conducting some exploratory data analysis. Then, we will train a random forest model on the data. After making the model, we can evaluate its accuracy on the test set and account for any issues that arise. We will also calculate variable importance scores to determine which predictors serve the largest roles in determining the prediction. This model is further developed by adding training controls.

# Abstract

The objective of this vignette is to provide an overview of predictive analysis methods as applied to a NFL play-by-play data. Specifically, we will be utilizing neural net architectures for time series data to predict game winners based on data from previous seasons. In order to do this, we need to preprocess the NFLFastR dataset for time series, train a neural network to forecast binary game outcomes (win/loss), and test the effectiveness of our model.
